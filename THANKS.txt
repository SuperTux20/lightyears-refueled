20,000 Light-Years Into Space
version 1.5


This reboot of 20k Lightyears is managed by Tux Penguin, but it wouldn't be possible without the original development team:

* Jack Whitham				original lead developer
* Cris Grada				graphics designer
* Siegfried-A. Gevatter		man page author
* Josh Holland				peaceful mode creator
* Richard Jones				Jack's original inspiration
* All the other great people that contributed code and ideas to the original project, you're important too :)
